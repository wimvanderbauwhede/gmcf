#  ModelLibPaths: ['libmodel1.a', 'libmodel2.a'] # if just a filename, should be in Models, else must be a full path

# I need a simple configuration
# We must describe the model in terms of what it requires, what it provides, and the time frequency.
# In principle each model could provide/required each variable with a different time step and offset
# 
#       Provides: [To: 3, [Var: 'real(4) u(128,128,128)', Step: 2, Offset: 2], [Var: 'real(4) v(128,128,128)'], [Var: 'real(4) v(128,128,128)'] ]
# and of course then the Requires must match up
# Also, the variables don't have in general the same names, so we must have something like ' model1 requires vx from model2 as u
# As the idea is to generate all of this anyway, maybe  'real(4) u(-1:129,0:127,1:128)' could become real/double/int/long, name, dim as array
# Yet another complication is that we often will require a part of an array, so we need a way to describe exactly what we want.
# This seems to lead us back to set comprehensions and even SAC, which is nice.
